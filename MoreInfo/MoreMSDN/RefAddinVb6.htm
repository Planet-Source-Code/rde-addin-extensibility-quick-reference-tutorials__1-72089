<h2>Creating a reference with the Add-In designer</h2>
<p>
You can create a reference to an add-in with the Add-In designer. To do this: 
<ol start=4>
<li>
Create a new Add-In project (if you haven't done so already), <br><br></li>
<li>
Double-click the Add-In designer "Connect" in the Project window. This brings up the Add-In designer.<br><br></li>
<li>
In Display Name, enter the name of your add-in that will later appear in the Add-In Manager dialog box.<br><br></li>
<li>
In Add-In Description, enter a description of what the add-in does.<br><br></li>
<li>
In Application and Application Version, choose the host application and its version, in this case, Visual Basic version 6.0.<br><br></li>
<li>
In Initial Load Behavior, choose how your add-in loads:<ul type=disc>
<li>
<b>Command Line/Startup:</b> Add-in loads either when specifically invoked from a command-line parameter, or when Visual Basic starts.<br><br></li>
<li>
<b>Command Line:</b> Add-in loads only when specifically invoked from a command-line parameter.<br><br></li>
<li>
<b>Startup:</b> Add-in loads when you start Visual Basic.<br><br></li>
<li>
<b>None:</b> Add-in doesn't load when you start Visual Basic.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Check "Add-In is command-line safe (Does not put up any UI)" if you wish your add-in to run without displaying any dialog boxes boxes or forms—that is, run "behind the scenes" without any visible interface.<br><br></li>
<li>
Select the <b>Advanced</b> tab to enter additional information on localization resources, and registry settings, if applicable.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Once the above information is filled out and you compile your project, your new add-in will appear in the Add-In Manager's list of available add-ins. Also, when the add-in ActiveX component is registered on a target system, your add-in will appear in the Add-In Manager's list of available add-ins.</p>
