Tutorial on how to test a VB Add-In

1.) Open up the Add-In project in VB and Run it.

2.) Open a new, Second Instance of VB and select a New or Existing project.
    Check the Add-Ins Manager to make sure that the Add-In project is listed
    and that the correct options are selected for that add-in
    (e.g.. "Loaded", "Load on startup").

As long as the Add-In Project is running in the First Instance,
it should also appear on the Add-Ins menu in the Second Instance.

The only drawback to this is that by Stopping the First Instance
you may get a warning in the Second Instance that it is trying to
use it (the First Instance).

It will still let you stop and it might ask you if you want to
remove it from the list of available add-ins, and the Menu item for
the add-in may not be removed from the Menu.

So, it's always a good idea to Unload the add-in you're testing with the
Add-In Manager in the Second Instance, before completely stopping the Add-In
project in the First Instance.

You can set breakpoints and break, but before you Stop, always go back to
Second Instance and unload it from the add-ins list (or close the test IDE)
to avoid this little caveat when building and debugging add-ins.
