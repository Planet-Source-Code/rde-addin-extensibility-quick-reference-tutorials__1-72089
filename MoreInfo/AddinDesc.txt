Where on Earth is an Add-ins's Description

In VB6 you'll find it in the Connect Designer under Addin Display Name.
Requires a reference to the Microsoft Add-In Designer library.

If in VB4 or you are implementing IDTExtensibility in a VB5 class:

Every now and then someone asks me

"How can I modify the default description that is associated to an add-in
I have written and that appears in the Add-In Manager? I tried to modify
the Project's Description attribute, but it didn't work". 

The answer is simple, even though this detail is not documented in the VB
manuals and when I wrote my first add-in I had to load the source code into
Notepad to understand what to do. 

The description that appears in the Add-In Manager window is actually the
Description attribute of the Connect class of the add-in, not of the project.

While this might be absurd, it has some logic: theoretically, an add-in
project might include several Connect class, each one corresponding to a
separate add-in utility (I say theoretically because I don't see any use
in doing that...), therefore the add-in's description is actually an
attribute of the class, not of the project.

Even when I understood what the add-in's description corresponds to, I had
to find out how to modify it from within the Visual Basic environment.

While you can modify the description of a property or a method from within
the Procedure Attributes dialog invoked from the Tools menu, you can't do the
same for the attribute of a class. To access the proper dialog box you must: 

(1) press F2 to show the Object Browser, 
(2) right-click on the class name in the left-most pane, and 
(3) select the Properties item in the popup menu that appears.
