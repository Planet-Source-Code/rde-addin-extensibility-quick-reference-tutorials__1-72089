### Description



Addin Extensibility Quick Reference + Tutorials

The VB5/6 IDE exposes a powerful object model that lets you manipulate VB's environment. It gives you control of your projects, components, modules, procedures, and even individual lines of code. You can customize all the menus and toolbars of the environment; trap nearly every user action, such as adding a new component or renaming an old one; open, scroll, move, and close all the code windows ...

All this power comes at a price, however: the extensibility object model is rather complex, and you must spend some time acquainting yourself with how it works ...

Hopefully, this extensibility quick reference will help you familiarise yourself more quickly and offers this information in a handy code format ...

Now includes some tips and a couple of small MSDN tutorials ...

Please report any errors or omissions - happy coding.
